                    <p>Here are some of my current ideas for the Physics Personal Project: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b> Computer Science </b>
                            <ul>
                                <li> The main idea I have related to computer science is creating a simulator or physics
                                    engine. In particular, I could connect this to my next idea and create a physics
                                    engine that simulates a rocket launch based on different modifications and
                                    conditions. </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b> Space Flight/Astronautics </b>
                            <ul>
                                <li> This idea is more hands-on, and the final product would involve building a physical
                                    rocket myself. I would have to answer questions such as:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li> How do rockets work? </li>
                                        <li> How do you launch a rocket successfully (connecting to Newton's third law,
                                            thrust, and other physics equations)? </li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b> Astrophysics </b>
                            <ul>
                                <li> It would be more difficult to relate this topic to the course material and create
                                    an experiment that I could conduct, but astrophysics interests me. I am not too sure
                                    about what exactly I would focus on, but I could talk about the different
                                    characteristics of planets in space, such as their rotation (conservation of angular
                                    momentum) causing their orbit.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b> Robotics/Some Sort of Machine </b>
                            <ul>
                                <li> Combining computer science with a more hands-on project, I want to create something
                                    that can predict the trajectory and landing spot of a ball using a camera. This idea
                                    is pretty ambitious, and I would need to research the viability of building
                                    something capable of this, but it nicely connects the course with my passions.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b> Wireless Charging </b>
                            <ul>
                                <li> Wireless charging is another hands-on project that nicely connects course material
                                    with real-life technology. Wireless charging relies on magnetic fields and transfers
                                    energy to your phone without a wire (duh). For the final product of this project, I
                                    would build a wireless charger for my phone.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b> The Physics of Flight </b>
                            <ul>
                                <li> This idea is similar to rocketry, and I would be building many planes to test the
                                    factors affecting flight. This idea interests me because I can conduct experiments
                                    and go through multiple models to improve the design of my aircraft to optimize
                                    distance. There are a lot of things I can fiddle around with, and the flexibility is
                                    appealing.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
