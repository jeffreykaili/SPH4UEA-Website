                    <h2 class="section-heading">Measuring Success</h2>
                    <p> Overall, I am quite happy with how the project turned out. In the end, I was actually able to
                        create a physics engine and demonstrate it by simulating some cool scenarios (found at the last
                        minute of the video). More importantly, I learned about how computers simulate physics,
                        improving my knowledge in both physics and math. It was very convenient learning about impulse
                        in class and then using it in my engine a few days later. I am most proud of my video — I love
                        how it turned out, and I think it reflected my learning and work in this Personal Physics
                        Project very well. I also learned to animate using Manim, which is something I have been meaning
                        to do for a while, and it was great being able to tie it into something productive :)</p>
                    <p> I think it's appropriate to provide the code used to create all the
                        animations in the video, which can be found <a
                            href="https://github.com/jeffreykaili/PPP-manim/blob/main/scene.py" target=_blank>here</a>.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Areas for Improvement</h2>
                    <p>I wanted to implement my physics engine for all polygons and ellipses, but after spending several
                        frustrating days on it, I decided my math and physics knowledge was not good enough to upgrade
                        my current engine of rectangles and polygons. </p>
                    <p>Additionally, I really lacked in the blogging
                        department for the primary research after adding my first iteration of the physics engine. After
                        adding a new component, it felt so boring to go back and write about what I did (I also dislike
                        writing), so I didn't do
                        it. Next time, I should at least make an effort to record videos of each additional component
                        and upload it to the blog to record my progress. </p>
                    <p>Finally, there were two minor errors in my
                        video, which I could have
                        eliminated if I had
                        finished earlier and sent it to more peers (although the video you are seeing is the fourth
                        revision).</p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Concluding Words</h2>
                    <p> I don't see much benefit for making my reflection long — I'm proud of my project, and my video
                        reflects my learning and final product very well. There's always room for improvement, and I
                        don't think my work with this physics engine ends with SPH4UE-A. I'm genuinely passionate about
                        this project, and in the future, I want to extend it to support polygons and ellipses. Who
                        knows, maybe the next time you check this blog, I'll have posted a new update about new shapes!
                    </p>
                    <p>I'm happy with how much I learned over the past four months, and I hope you've learned something
                        from my journey as well. ☺︎</p>
