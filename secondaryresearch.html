                        <p> Roughly speaking, there are three stages that our engine loops through to simulate
                            two-dimensional physics. The procedure is as follows: </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li> Contact Detection </li>
                            <li> Contact Resolution </li>
                            <li> State Integration </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p> Then, each frame of our physics engine renders the updated results. We will dive further
                            into
                            each stage, but first, we need to review vectors as they're crucial to understanding and
                            implementing a physics engine. </p>
                    </div>


                    <div>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Vectors</h2>
                        <p> A vector is an object that has both a <u><b>magnitude</b></u> and a <u><b>direction</b></u>.
                            Intuitively,
                            we can represent
                            this object with an arrow, with the length representing the magnitude and the direction the
                            arrow is pointing indicating the direction.</p>
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/vector.png" alt="..."
                            style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" />
                        <p>We can denote a two-dimensional vector like&nbsp \(\overrightarrow{a} = (a_{x}, a_{y})\).
                            If this vector is represented in the Cartesian coordinate system, this notation means that
                            the tail of the vector is at the origin \((0, 0)\), and the head is at the point \((a_{x},
                            a_{y})\). For example, if we have&nbsp \(\overrightarrow{a} = (4, 2)\), it corresponds to
                            this vector: </p>
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/examplevector.png" alt="..."
                            style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; width: 40%; height: 40%;" />
                        <span class="caption text-muted">Image Credit: Khan Academy</span>
                        <p> We can also perform algebraic operations on vectors. Firstly, the <u><b>length</b></u> of a
                            vector,
                            denoted by \(||\)&nbsp\(||\), can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem. More
                            formally, </p>
                        <p style="text-align: center;"> \(||\)&nbsp\(\overrightarrow{a}\)&nbsp\(||\) = \(\sqrt{a_{x}^{2}
                            + a_{y}^{2}}\)</p>
                        <p> When a vector is <u><b>negated</u></b>, its magnitude remains the same, but its direction
                            reverses. If&nbsp \(\overrightarrow{a} = (a_{x}, a_{y})\), the negation of&nbsp
                            \(\overrightarrow{a}\)&nbsp is:</p>
                        <p style="text-align: center;"> \(-\overrightarrow{a} = (-a_{x}, -a_{y})\)</p>
                        <p> You will see why this is useful soon. We can also <u><b>add</b></u> two vectors together.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: center;"> \(\overrightarrow{a} + \overrightarrow{b} = (a_{x} + b_{x},
                            a_{y} + b_{y})\) </p>
                        <p> The application of negating a vector becomes immediately obvious. Subtracting two
                            vectors&nbsp\(\overrightarrow{a}\)&nbsp and &nbsp\(\overrightarrow{b}\)&nbsp is identical to
                            adding &nbsp\(\overrightarrow{a}\)&nbsp and &nbsp\(-\overrightarrow{b}\)&nbsp. More
                            formally,
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: center;"> \(\overrightarrow{a} - \overrightarrow{b} = \overrightarrow{a} +
                            (-\overrightarrow{b}) = (a_{x} - b_{x}, a_{y} - b_{y})\) </p>

                        <p> We now move into multiplication. Firstly, vectors can be multiplied by a
                            <u><b>scalar</b></u> quantity, which we will define as any real number. The effect is that
                            the vector's magnitude is scaled by a factor of the scalar quantity. Moreover, if the scalar
                            quantity is negative, the direction of the vector reverses. <br> <br> Let \(s\) be the
                            scalar quantity:
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: center;"> \(s\overrightarrow{a} = (sa_{x}, sa_{y})\)</p>
                        <p> There are two ways we can multiply two vectors together. The first way is calculating the
                            <u><b>dot product</b></u> of two vectors. It's denoted as&nbsp \(\overrightarrow{a} \cdot
                            \overrightarrow{b}\)&nbsp and it is a <b>scalar</b> quantity that essentially
                            describes the "same-ness" of two vectors. There are multiple ways to compute the dot
                            product (which is a <b>commutative</b> operation), but it's easier to calculate it using the
                            components of the two vectors, especially
                            since we are working in two dimensions.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: center;"> \(\overrightarrow{a} \cdot \overrightarrow{b} = a_{x}b_{x} +
                            a_{y}b_{y}\)</p>
                        <p> It's also commonly defined as: </p>
                        <p style="text-align: center;"> \(\overrightarrow{a} \cdot \overrightarrow{b} = ||a|| \times
                            ||b||cos(\theta )\)</p>
                        <p> Where \(\theta\) is the angle between the two vectors. Although this definition is uglier to
                            implement in code, it can be used to find the angle between two vectors. </p>
                        <p style="text-align: center;"> \(||a||\times ||b||cos(\theta ) = a_{x}b_{x} +
                            a_{y}b_{y}\)<br><br>\(cos(\theta ) = \frac{a_{x}b_{x} + a_{y}b_{y}}{||a||\times ||b||}\)
                            <br><br> \(\theta = cos^{-1}(\frac{a_{x}b_{x} + a_{y}b_{y}}{||a||\times ||b||})\)
                        </p>

                        <p> There's a lot to unpack here. First, I'll cover the fundamental algorithms required for this
                            stage of the physics engine and then optimizations that enable better performance. </p>
                        <p> <u><b>Representing Objects</b></u> </p>
                        <p> To determine if two shapes intersect in our physics engine, we must understand how to
                            represent them. </p>
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/convexvsconcave.jpg" alt="..."
                            style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" />
                        <p> Shapes can either be <b>convex</b> or <b>concave</b>. In a convex shape, a line segment
                            connecting any two points within the shape is always fully contained inside the shape.
                            Conversely, inside a concave shape, this statement is untrue. Convex shapes are much easier
                            to work with, and there are many distance/intersection algorithms that we can implement for
                            them. Consequently, it's desired that we represent all concave objects with a convex shape.
                            Thus,
                            we arrive at the famous convex hull problem. <br> <br>
                            <b> Convex Hull Problem </b> <br> <br>
                            The convex hull problem is defined as finding the smallest <b>convex</b> polygon that
                            encloses all the points in a set.
                        </p>
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/convex_hull.png" alt="..."
                            style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" />
                        <p> The convex hull of the points given in \(a\) is shown in diagram \(b\). This algorithm can
                            then be used on any concave shape in our physics engine - each vertex is a distinct point,
                            and the convex hull is the convex representation of the object. Since optimization is not a
                            priority yet, we'll first detail an \(O(N^{2})\) algorithm to compute the convex hull, where
                            \(N\) is the number of vertices in the shape. </p>
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/giftwrapping.gif" alt="..."
                            style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" />
                        <p> Let \(S\) be the set of vertices of the shape. The <b>Jarvis march</b> algorithm, animated
                            above, starts at the leftmost point in \(S\), since the convex hull <b>must</b> include this
                            point. Then, we iterate as follows: </p>
                        <p>
                        <pre><code>X = leftmost point in S
while bestPoint != leftmost point in S:
    Add X to the hull
    bestPoint := S[0]
    for p := each point in S:
        if p is on the left of the line formed from X to bestPoint:
            bestPoint = p 
    X = bestPoint</code></pre>
                        </p>
                        <p> If we are at a point on our convex hull \(P_{i}\), we select the next point
                            \(P_{i+1}\) such that all the points excluding \(P_{i}\) and \(P_{i+1}\) in \(S\) are to the
                            right of the line formed between \(P_{i}\) and \(P_{i+1}\). Let the leftmost point in \(S\)
                            be \(L\). Since \(L\) <b>must</b> be included in the convex hull, \(P_{0} = L\), and the
                            convex hull is built clockwise, terminating when \(P_{i+1} = P_{0}\). <br><br>The worst case
                            is when
                            the convex hull contains \(N\) vertices, and since we loop through all the points in \(S\)
                            (note \(|S| = N\)) for every vertex of the hull, our time complexity is \(O(N^{2})\).
                        </p>
                        <p> The most obvious flaw is that when we approximate a concave shape with a convex shape, the
                            original body loses its concave properties. Usually, this is not a problem, but there are
                            situations where the concave properties are important to the behaviour of an object (such as
                            a cup). For these scenarios, we can use <b>convex decomposition</b>, a method where we
                            represent a
                            concave object as a set of convex shapes. </p>

                        <p> <u><b>Testing for Intersections</b></u> </p>
                        <p> Now that we can represent objects, we must test whether two convex polygons intersect. To
                            achieve this, we can use the <b>Separating Axis Theorem</b> (SAT), which states that two
                            objects do
                            not overlap if there exists a line (called axis) onto which both the object's projections do
                            not intersect. <br><br>It can be shown that this line must be parallel to one of the sides
                            of the
                            polygon, and so, we can use the following algorithm:
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                Calculate the perpendicular vectors for the edges of each polygon. <br><br>
                                <img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/sat1.png" alt="..."
                                    style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" />
                                <br>
                            </li>
                            <li> Project each vertex of the two polygons onto each perpendicular vector. <br><br>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> <img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/sat2.png" alt="..."
                                            style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" />
                                        For each polygon on a perpendicular vector, we take the highest and lowest
                                        point of the vertex projections to calculate each polygon's projection. </li>
                                </ul>

                                Finally, we check the projections overlap. If there exists a perpendicular vector in
                                which the two projections <b>do not</b> overlap, the two objects are not
                                intersecting.<br><br>

                        <p>
                            To implement this into code, we need a more rigorous procedure. Here is a well-defined
                            mathematical approach that should assist with programming the detection.
                        <ol>
                            <li> For the first step, we need to review some vector math. Firstly, the vertices of our
                                object will be represented with coordinates, so we need to find out how to calculate a
                                vector based on two coordinates. Let \(c_{1}\) be the first vertex, \(c_{2}\) be the
                                second vertex.
                                <p style="text-align: center;"> \(\overrightarrow{v_{c_{1}c_{2}}} = c_{2} - c_{1} =
                                    (c_{2_{x}} - c_{1_{x}}, c_{2_{y}} - c_{1_{y}})\)</p>

                                Next, to calculate a
                                <b>perpendicular</b> vector, we swap the \(x\) and \(y\) components, and then negate the
                                \(x\) component. More formally, given \(\overrightarrow{v} = (v_{x}, v_{y})\),
                                <p style="text-align: center;"> \(\overrightarrow{v_{\perp}} = (-v_{y}, v_{x})\)</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                To calculate the projection of each vertex on the perpendicular vector, we use the dot
                                product. Essentially, if \(v_{\perp}\) is our perpendicular vector, we calculate
                                \(\overrightarrow{v} \cdot x_{i}\), where \(x_{i}\) is each vertex inside our polygon.
                                Then, we take the minimum and maximum of the projected points, representing our
                                polygon's projection.
                                <img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/projection.png" alt="..."

                            </li>
                            <li>Finally, we can check if these projections are overlapping. If they are not overlapping,
                                the two polygons are not intersecting. Otherwise, we check the other perpendicular
                                vectors. </li>
                        </ol>
                        </p>
                        <p> The Separating Axis Theorem is quite excessive if we are working with basic shapes. As a
                            remedy, we can use custom functions to detect collisions when working with specific shapes,
                            such as circles or rectangles. </p>
                        <p> If we detect a collision, we will extract two pieces of information — a collision normal
                            vector and a collison depth scalar value. </p>
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/collide.png" alt="..."
                            style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" />
                        <p> The collision normal vector is a <b>normalized</b> (unit) vector that tells us the direction
                            in which the two shapes have collided and the collision depth is a scalar value that tells
                            us how far the two bodies have already overlapped. With that, we can forward this
                            information to the next stage of our engine.

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Contact Resolution</h2>
                        <p> When resolving a collision, we want to consider a variety of factors such as the direction
                            and depth of the collision and any properties of the two objects, such as their mass,
                            orientation, and velocity. In addition, to simulate realistic physics, two intersecting
                            objects should be separated by the next frame.
                        </p>
                        <p> We can take a variety of approaches, but one way is to mimic the real world and apply
                            impulses to both colliding bodies to change their velocities. Remember, impulse is defined
                            as a <b>change in momentum</b>, and is equal to \(m \Delta \vec{v}\), so if we calculate the
                            impulse, we can isolate for \(\Delta \vec{v}\text{ }\) to calculate an object's change in
                            velocity after a collision. </p>
                        <iframe width="100%" height="600px" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tTt886y0rWI"></iframe>
                        <p> This method is also grounded in reality. When two objects contact in real life, they
                            experience a force over some time (\(\vec{F} \Delta t\)), which is impulse. Let's call the
                            two colliding objects
                            \(A\) and \(B\).</p>
                        <p> The first step is to calculate the relative velocity between the colliding objects. </p>
                        <p style="text-align: center;"> \(\vec{v}_{r} = \vec{v}_B - \vec{v}_A\)</p>
                        <p> This equation determines the relative velocity of \(B\) with respect to \(A\). The relative
                            velocity is important because regardless of the velocity of both objects, if two scenarios
                            have the same relative velocity, the response to the collision should be indentical. That
                            is, whether
                            the objects are moving at \(2m/s\) and \(4m/s\) or \(8m/s\) and \(10m/s\), the change in
                            velocity of the slower objects in both scenarios should be the same, and the change in
                            velocity of the faster objects in both scenarios should also be the same. <a

                                target=_blank>Here's</a> a
                            nice interactive that demonstrates this idea. </p>
                        <p> Since we only care about the relative velocity that is in the direction of the collision,
                            we'll calculate the dot product with our collision normal vector. </p>
                        <p style="text-align: center;"> \(\vec{v}_{r} = (\vec{v}_B - \vec{v}_A) \cdot \vec{n}\)</p>
                        <p> Next, let's think about the types of collisions that can occur. It should be pretty clear
                            that <b>what</b> the two objects are made of will impact the response to the
                            collision. For example, imagine dropping a marble and a rubber ball with equal masses
                            onto the floor — you'd expect the rubber ball to bounce much higher. The ratio of the final
                            relative velocity to the initial relative velocity between two objects after their collision
                            is known as the coefficient of restitution, and it represents the conversion of kinetic
                            energy to heat energy. Let \(\overrightarrow{RV_{i}}\) be the initial relative velocity and
                            \(\overrightarrow{RV_{f}}\) be the final relative velocity. The coefficient of restitution,
                            denoted with the symbol \(e\) is then: </p>
                        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 26px;">
                            \(e=\frac{|\overrightarrow{RV_{f}}|}{|\overrightarrow{RV_{i}}|}\)</p>
                        <p> So, \(e = 1\) represents a perfectly elastic collision where <b>no kinetic energy is
                                lost</b>, and \(e = 0\) represents a perfectly inelastic collision, where the objects
                            fuse together
                            and <b>maximum kinetic energy is lost.</b> Consequently, it would make sense if \(0 \leq e
                            \leq 1\), but technically \(e > 1\) can occur if the objects <b>gain</b> kinetic energy
                            (possible in some cases). However, we won't deal with those rare cases. When \(e \in (0,
                            1)\), the collision is <b>inelastic</b>, and some kinetic energy is converted to heat. In
                            essence, we want our collision response between two steel balls to be different than the
                            collision response between two rubber balls. </p>
                        <p> Our end goal is to calculate the impulse scalar (\(J\)), which we can dot product with our
                            collision
                            normal to get the impulse. So, building off our relative velocity, we'll multiply it with
                            \((1 + e)\) to account for the coefficient of restitution. </p>
                        <p style="text-align: center;"> \(J = (1 + e)(\vec{v}_B - \vec{v}_A) \cdot \vec{n}\)</p>
                        <p> From the real world and Newton's third law, the collision should point the objects in the
                            opposite direction, so we will add a negative sign to our equation.</p>
                        <p style="text-align: center;"> \(J = -(1 + e)(\vec{v}_B - \vec{v}_A) \cdot \vec{n}\)</p>
                        <p> This current equation is fine, but we haven't considered the masses of the two objects. From
                            the Conservation of Momentum, the total momentum before and after the collision should be
                            identical. The easiest way to conserve momentum is to divide our current value of \(J\) by
                            the sum of the inverse masses of the objects. </p>
                        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 28px;"> \(J = \frac{-(1 + e)(\vec{v}_B - \vec{v}_A)
                            \cdot \vec{n}}{m_{A}^{-1} + m_{B}^{-1}}\)</p>
                        <p> To explain why this works, let's quickly discuss how we'll use the impulse to calculate each
                            object's change in velocity. </p>
                        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 26px;"> \(\vec{J} = m \Delta v \rightarrow \Delta v =
                            \frac{\vec{J}}{m}\)</p>
                        <p> So, the change in velocity is equal to the impulse vector divided by an object's mass. Thus,
                            when we divide our velocity by the sum of the inverse masses, it scales the impulse so that
                            each object gets the correct proportion of the total energy/momentum of the entire
                            collision. Finally, to get the impulse, we'll multiply this \(J\) value by our collision
                            normal vector. </p>
                        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 26px;"> \(\vec{J} = (\frac{-(1 + e)(\vec{v}_B -
                            \vec{v}_A)
                            \cdot \vec{n}}{m_{A}^{-1} + m_{B}^{-1}})\vec{n}\)</p>
                        <p> Then, we just use our earlier equation to apply this impulse and calculate the change in
                            velocity of both objects. Now, let's move on to adding angular components. </p>
                        <p> The rotational equivalent of linear force is torque (\(\vec{\tau} \)).
                            When calculating linear velocity, all the points within an object move at the same
                            rate. Based on Newton's second law (\(F = ma\), the acceleration is dependent on the force
                            acting upon an object and its <b>mass</b>. Logically, we might conclude that the amount of
                            angular acceleration an object experiences is also dependent on torque and the object's
                            mass. However, when we apply torque, we're changing angular velocity, moving the body such
                            that
                            the mass farther from its centre of mass moves <b>more</b> than mass closer to its centre of
                            mass. </b></p>
                        <p> So, the amount of angular acceleration an object experiences for a certain torque is based
                            on "the moment of inertia," which describes the distribution of an object's mass around each
                            axis and tells us how resistant this object is to rotation. Usually, we'd represent an
                            object's moment of inertia using a special type of matrix known as a <b>tensor</b>. Each
                            dimension in the tensor tells us about rotation along a certain axis, so if a body undergoes
                            rotations about all three axes, we'd need a 3x3 matrix. </p>
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/tensorjpg.jpg" alt="..."
                            style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" />
                        <p> Luckily, when we're working in two dimensions, <b>all rotations occur on the z-axis</b>.
                            This means that our tensor is a 1x1 matrix or simply a scalar value! Now, we can use some
                            established equations to calculate the moment of inertia for different shapes. </p>
                        <p> For rectangles with mass \(m\), length \(l\), and width \(w\), the moment of inertia
                            (\(I_{r}\)) is:</p>
                        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 24px;"> \(I_{r}=\frac{1}{12}(l^2+w^2)m\)</p>
                        <p> For circles with mass \(m\) and radius \(r\), the moment of inertia
                            (\(I_{c}\)) is:</p>
                        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 24px;"> \(I_{c}=\frac{1}{2}mr^2\)</p>
                        <p> Now, we'll apply an <b>angular impulse</b> to change <b>angular velocity</b>, much like how
                            we
                            calculated a <b>linear impulse </b>to change <b>linear velocity</b>. </p>
                        <p> Let \(\vec{r}\text{ }\) be the relative position of the collision point from the object's
                            centre of
                            mass. We apply the impulse to our current angular velocity \(av\): </p>
                        <p style="text-align: center;"> \(av = av \pm I^{-1}(\vec{r} \times \vec{J})\)</p>
                        <p> The plus-minus depends on which object we're applying the angular impulse to (since the
                            impulses should point in opposite directions). Then, the combined impulse calculation is:
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 32px;">

                            its
                            position. The easiest way is to simply implement some known physics equations. </p>
                        <p> Let \(n\) be the current frame of our engine. First, we'll calculate the acceleration by
                            dividing force by mass. </p>
                        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 26px;">
                            \(\vec{a}_{n} = \frac{\vec{F}}{m}\)</p>
                        <p> Then, use this acceleration to compute the new velocity: </p>
                        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 26px;">
                            \(\vec{v}_{n+1} = \vec{v}_{n} + \vec{a}_{n} \Delta t\)</p>
                        <p> And finally, compute the new position: </p>
                        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 26px;">
                            \(\vec{p}_{n+1} = \vec{p}_{n} + \vec{v}_{n+1}\Delta t\)</p>
                        <p> You might ask, what is the value of \(\Delta t\)? If we cap our physics engine at 60 frames
                            per second, the \(\Delta t\) has a constant value of \(\frac{1}{60}\text{s}\). Obviously,
                            this method is flawed if the simulation ever drops below 60 frames, but we won't worry about that
                            for now. </p>
