                    <p> Although I am interested in all the topics from my brainstorming, I narrowed it down to
                        <b>two</b> main ideas based on my specific skills and passions. Computer science is where I
                        excel the most, and I think it would make sense to build my PPP around that. This also gives me
                        room to go above and beyond and explore different avenues that I wouldn't be able to do with the
                        other topics because of the lack of comfort. Looking at my conclusions:
                    </p>
                    <b> Space Flight/Astronautics - </b> <b style="color: red"> Rejected </b>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Alongside being an expensive idea, I've already built a rocket before (given it was built
                            blindly without any real consideration for physics). Although this is a school assignment, I
                            want to do something new because the unfamiliarity allows for curiosity which drives me to
                            learn. Also, redoing something I've done before reduces the fun :(
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <b> Astrophysics - </b> <b style="color: red"> Rejected </b>
                    <ul>
                        <li> From the brainstorming, it was pretty evident that this was not a topic I was well-versed
                            in. Space and astrophysics interest me, and that is why they ended up as potential topics.
                            It's such a broad field that I have no experience or knowledge in, and I was hoping for an
                            idea that would have prompted an experiment/final product or even narrowed the topic down,
                            but since nothing came, I think I'll set this idea down for now.
                        </li>
                    </ul>


                    <b> Wireless Charging - </b> <b style="color: red"> Rejected </b>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Wireless charging was an idea I was considering because it is a real-world application of
                            magnetic fields. However, reflecting on this idea, it is not a topic that particularly
                            interests me. I feel like my lack of interest would result in a sub-par project, and thus, I
                            want to select a topic that I am passionate about.
                        </li>
                    </ul>


                    <b> The Physics of Flight - </b> <b style="color: red"> Rejected </b>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Looking back, this idea was pretty similar to rocketry. I thought one benefit would be that
                            it was cheaper (?) than rocketry, and I would be able to go through more models. However, if
                            I'm not working with paper airplanes (I already did "the best paper airplane design" in
                            grade 6), the cost would not be much cheaper, if at all. It's still a pretty appealing
                            topic, but factoring in the prices and the fact that other classmates have already selected
                            flight as their idea, I'm going to go for something else.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Accepted Topics</h2>
                    <p> Out of the six topics I brainstormed originally, it came down to these two. </p>
                    <b> Robotics/Some Sort of Machine - </b> <b style="color: green"> Accepted </b>
                    <ul>
                        <li> My idea for this topic was to create a program that could predict the landing of a ball
                            using two cameras - one would be positioned in front of the ball, and one would be
                            positioned to the side. The camera on the side would capture the x/y-axis movement, and the
                            front camera would capture the z-axis movement.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/camera.jpg" alt="..." />
                    <span class="caption text-muted">A rough sketch of what each camera would capture to predict the
                        ball's trajectory. </span>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Using this information, values such as the velocity, acceleration, and height above the
                            ground could be calculated, allowing for an estimation of where the ball would land.
                        </li>
                        <li> However, I decided to not go with this idea for my PPP because:
                            <ol>
                                <li> I don't have a table where I can build this machine and keep it there for four
                                    months.
                                </li>
                                <li> I don't have the two cameras I would need to track the ball. </li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li> Even though I do not have much experience with computer vision, this would be my choice if
                            it was convenient. Unfortunately, I don't think it's realistic right now, but I plan to
                            revisit it in the future.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <b> Physics Simulations - </b> <b style="color: green"> Accepted + PPP Topic! </b>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Simulating physics was the topic I selected because it was the most realistic and gave me
                            the most freedom - I feel like I have lots of opportunities to learn and explore beyond the
                            project. It also made sense because I wanted a topic that had real-world applications.
                            Although I struggled to find direct connections, I spoke with Mr. Fong and he recommended
                            that I create a physics engine - a bridge between accurately simulating physics while still
                            providing room for minor errors. It's also less computationally intensive, and I also play
                            plenty of video games :)
